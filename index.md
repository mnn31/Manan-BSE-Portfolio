# Tilt Controlled Marble Maze
This deceptively simple yet perfect game combines my love for robotics with a classic game, mazes. Using an accelerometer on the Circuit Playground Express board to control the X and Y directions of motion of a maze, the user can guide a marble through the maze by simply tilting the CPX. What's neat is that this project is constructed using only cardboard, hot glue, and a couple of screws.

# Code
One of things that I'm sure I will take away from BlueStamp is how I learnt Object Oriented programming. To understand this code, I had Gemini AI teach me the basics of OOP. I then applied this in my code. This OOP code is the heart and soul of the project: it communicates with the CPX, which tells how and when the servo-motors should move. Different from standard user input-output programs, this code must take in input the "tilting" of the CPX; detect the direction of tilt; pick the correct motor (x- or y-direction motor); tell the servo to move in the appropriate angle.

# Bill of Materials
One of the more affordable projects, the Marble Maze requires very few technical components: these being the CircuitPython Express Board and the two Servos. Most of the other items are generic and can probably be found in an Office Depot/some Toolshop. This includes a Hot Glue Gun, Wires, etc. For cardboard, I used scrap cardboard from Amazon packages, and they worked perfectly!

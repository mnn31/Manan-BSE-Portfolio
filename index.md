# Robotics meets Retro: 
# Gyroscopic Marble Maze!
This deceptively simple yet perfect game combines my love for robotics with a classic game, mazes. Using an accelerometer on the Circuit Playground Express board to control the X and Y directions of motion of a maze, the user can guide a marble through the maze by simply tilting the CPX. What's neat is that this project is constructed using only cardboard, hot glue, and a couple of screws.

For my first milestone, I faced several challenges while setting up the circuitry. First, I had to install all necessary software. Installing CircuitPython and setting up the board was tough due to unhelpful guides online. Finding and importing the `adafruit_motor` folder and `simpleio.mpy` file libraries into the `/lib` directory was particularly difficult, as I had to scour confusing github pages to download them. When I connected my laptop to the CPX, it showed up as disk `CPLAYBOOT` instead of `CIRCUITPY`, so I had to search online again to fix and reboot it using a `.uf2` file, which was to be dragged onto the file to reset it. The code, although mostly provided to me, immediately struck me as inefficient and repetitive. In fact, I asked Gemini AI to teach me the basics of Object Oriented Programming; OOP helped me work with objects, like the `Servo` object my code intitialized using the `pwmio` and `board` imported modules. This code detects the angle of tilt on the CPX, sends a signal to the appropriate servo (either the x- or y-servo) and replicates that angle. That was it for the code initially, although I'm definetely planning to edit and polish it up soon. Although the wiring was simple, clipping the alligator wires to the board was tricky due to there not being any holder, but instead small holes. In the end I just wedged each of them in there (Fig. 1). Despite these obstacles, I managed to get the servo motors connected and moving. The schematic was fairly easy to follow, and since I had worked with servos before I understood there are three connection that are to be made for a servo to work: the red wire, a power connection; the brown wire, a ground connection; and the yellow wire, the signal transmitter. Looking ahead, I plan to construct all the cardboard components, including the base, walls, all inner walls, the x-frame, and the base with y-pillars.

# Code
One of things that I'm sure I will take away from BlueStamp is how I learnt Object Oriented programming. To understand this code, I had Gemini AI teach me the basics of OOP. I then applied this in my code. This OOP code is the heart and soul of the project: it communicates with the CPX, which tells how and when the servo-motors should move. Different from standard user input-output programs, this code must take in input the "tilting" of the CPX; detect the direction of tilt; pick the correct motor (x- or y-direction motor); tell the servo to move in the appropriate angle.

# Bill of Materials
One of the more affordable projects, the Marble Maze requires very few technical components: these being the CircuitPython Express Board and the two Servos. Most of the other items are generic and can probably be found in an Office Depot/some Toolshop. This includes a Hot Glue Gun, Wires, etc. For cardboard, I used scrap cardboard from Amazon packages, and they worked perfectly!

# Starter Project

The calculator project seemed the most challenging out of all the starters. Given I had already worked with Arduino before, I naturally looked for the next skill in the world of robotics: soldering. This project was a solderer's dream; in fact, I had to solder in more than 50 holes! This calculator worked pretty much the same as any ordinary calculator. It has buttons for all ten digits and the four basic operations. More specifically, the bar chip was the brain of the calculator. This piece of hardware contained the code that detected which button was pressed and what that button signfified. between the two covers, a motherboard acts as a base for the entire calculator: all the parts were soldered to slits in the motherboard, which had in built connections to connect the entire matrix to the bar chip. The numbers and answer would be displayed on the LED display at the top of the calculator. This project gave me a really good intro to not just soldering byt robotics as a whole, due to the multitude of challenges I faced during the process. There was absolutely no instruction manual! However, once I got the hang of what was what, I was on a roll. However, due to the tiny dots of solder I had to expertly place, there were many times when the hot uron almost melted the motherboard itself, or adjacent soddered pieces would touch, shorting the entire circuit. All in all however, I came out of the experience stronger and ready to take on my intensive project: The Tilt-controlled Marble Maze.
